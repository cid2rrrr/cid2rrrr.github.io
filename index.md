# About Digable Planet.
Hope all is well, Iâ€™m **Seung-jae Lee (SJ Lee)**, aka **DJ Cooky**.
Rather than inventing something entirely new, I focus on reinterpreting existing elements from a fresh perspective, recreating them in the process.
Through this, I aim to bridge the past, present, and future.

DJ Cooky crafts music through **"alchemy shaped by respect"**
while SJ Lee emphasizes **"joy over performance"** in research.

In the realm of music, my goal is to create harmony between people and artificial intelligence, forming a unified whole.
By separating the identities of the musician and the researcher, I seek to merge them into one through the creation of **Digable Planet**.
